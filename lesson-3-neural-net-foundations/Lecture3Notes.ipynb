    "Jeremy Howard has a great chart which breaks down the top [Pytorch Image Model Architectures](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/which-image-models-are-best) which you can use to identify the best model for your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the chart you'll notice that the resnet family (specifically resnet18 and resnet34) are not the most accurate on the ImageNet dataset but they're incredibly fast which allows for quick iteration speed with your models. The most important thing to do with your V1 is to get it trained and predicting as quickly as possible so that you can immediately start identifying improvements; hence the use of Resnet models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, once you find a family of models that seems to work really well on your problem, you can start to get even more specific and choose versions (maybe you need something faster or more accurate).\n",

    "Below is an example of you can use the timm library to find a list of all models from a particular family"
